// This data type is defined in the same way as the 'PresenceInfo' data type, but with the OpenAPI 'nullable: true' property.  If the additionalPraId IE is present, this IE shall state the presence information of the UE for the individual PRA identified by the additionalPraId IE;  If the additionalPraId IE is not present, this IE shall state the presence information of the UE for the PRA identified by the praId IE.

This IE shall be present  if the Area of Interest subscribed or reported is a Presence Reporting Area or a Set of Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Areas. When present, it shall be encoded as a string representing an integer in the following ranges: - 0 to 8 388 607 for UE-dedicated PRA - 8 388 608 to 16 777 215 for Core Network predefined PRA Examples: PRA ID 123 is encoded as \"123\" PRA ID 11 238 660 is encoded as \"11238660\"
