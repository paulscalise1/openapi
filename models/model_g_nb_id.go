// Provides the G-NB identifier.
type GNbId struct {
	// Unsigned integer representing the bit length of the gNB ID as defined in clause 9.3.1.6 of 3GPP TS 38.413 [11], within the range 22 to 32.
	BitLength int32 `json:"bitLength" yaml:"bitLength" bson:"bitLength,omitempty"`
	// This represents the identifier of the gNB. The value of the gNB ID shall be encoded in hexadecimal representation. Each character in the string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\", \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent 4 bits. The padding 0 shall be added to make multiple nibbles,  the most significant character representing the padding 0 if required together with the 4 most significant bits of the gNB ID shall appear first in the string, and the character representing the 4 least significant bit of the gNB ID shall appear last in the string.
	GNBValue string `json:"gNBValue" yaml:"gNBValue" bson:"gNBValue,omitempty"`
