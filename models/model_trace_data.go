	// Trace Reference (see 3GPP TS 32.422).It shall be encoded as the concatenation of MCC, MNC and Trace ID as follows: 'MCC'<MNC'-'Trace ID'The Trace ID shall be encoded as a 3 octet string in hexadecimal representation. Each character in the Trace ID string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\", \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent 4 bits. The most significant character representing the 4 most significant bits of the Trace ID shall appear first  in the string, and the character representing the 4 least significant bit of the Trace ID shall appear last in the string.
